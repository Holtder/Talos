# AppStoreScraper
## Requirements
Make sure you have Python (3.6.8) and pip3 installed. There are many tutorials online that do a far better job on how to accomplish this than I ever could. Once you get that done, install the following python packages:

* Play Scraper
* requests
* Flask
* Flask SQLAlchemy
* WT Forms 

You can install these all at the same time using either:

`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

or 

`$ pip3 install play-scraper requests Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy WTForms`


## Notes
This is still a work in progress, proper installation instructions will follow.
