An infectious disease (ID) specialist's practice may consist largely of managing nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, or it may be out-patient based, in which case it focuses more on community-acquired infections. ID is historically associated with travel medicine and tropical medicine, as many diseases acquired in tropical and subtropical areas are infective in nature. ID specialists typically serve as consultants in cases of complex infections or immunologic issues, and often manage patients with HIV/AIDS and other forms of immunodeficiency.In the US, ID is a subspecialty of internal medicine or pediatrics (i.e., an internist or pediatrician trains for an additional 1-2 years as a medical fellow to qualify as an ID specialist and sit for the ID boards).There are four main kinds of germs:Bacteria - one-celled germs that multiply quickly and may release chemicals which can make you sickViruses - capsules that contain genetic material, and use your own cells to multiplyFungi - primitive plants, like mushrooms or mildewProtozoa - one-celled animals that use other living things for food and a place to liveNIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesThis educational & medical application is intended to r:NCLEX-RNNCLEX-PNNCLEXCNA,ANP - Adult Nurse PractitionerFNP - Family Nurse PractitionerA-GNP - Adult-Gero Primary Nurse PractitionerANP-BC Adult Nurse PractitionerFNP-BC Family Nurse PractitionerPNP-BC Pediatric Nurse PractitionerACNP-BC Acute Care Nurse PractitionerGNP - BC Gerontological Nurse PractitionerPMHNP-BC Adult Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse PractitionerPMHNP-BC Family Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse PractitionerCNRN®SCRN®and also for USMLE, COMLEX, ANCC Certification Center.This app is also suitable for  students, researchers, resident, doctors, Anatomy & physiology specialists, nurses and medical professionals and of course Medical lecturers, teachers and professors.Get a better score in your  USMLE  (step1, step2  CS & CK), PANCE, MCAT, DAT, COMLEX,CNA, OAT, NBDE,  or PCAT exam, and the most important  is to fall in love with the material, it worth all the attention.;Top of Learning;5921705092973127988;00;1.0;2.0 and up;2015-04-26;['Everyone']

com.bedieman.chlamydiaInfection;android;Chlamydia Infection;Chlamydia infection, often simply known as chlamydia, is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Most people who are infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination. Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles.The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Repeated infections of the eyes that go without treatment can result in trachoma, a common cause of blindness in the developing world. Chlamydia can be spread during vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth. The eye infections may also be spread by personal contact, flies, and contaminated towels in areas with poor sanitation. Chlamydia trachomatis only occurs in humans. Diagnosis is often by screening which is recommended yearly in sexually active women under the age of twenty five, others at higher risk, and at the first prenatal visit. Testing can be done on the urine or a swab of the cervix, vagina, or urethra.  Rectal or mouth swabs are required to diagnose infections in those areas.;bedieman;bedieman;00;1.0.0;4.1 and up;2018-04-14;['Everyone']
